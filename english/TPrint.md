## TPRINT Class

### oTPrintObject := TPRINT( cPrintLibrary )

The function call initializes the class and establishes the printing library to be used by the class. Returns an object that allows the configuration, creation and filing of a print job.

cPrintLibrary available values are:

* HBPRINTER: to print using HBprinter library.
* MINIPRINT: to print using Miniprint library.
* DOSPRINT: to print to a DOS printer.
* TXTPRINT: to generate a text file.
* EXCELPRINT: to generate an Excel file (Excel must be installed).
* CALCPRINT: to generate an OpenOffice Calc file (OpenOffice must be installed).
* RTFPRINT: to generate an RTF file.
* CSVPRINT: to generate a CSV file.
* HTMLPRINT: to generate an HTML file using EXCEL (default) or Calc.
* HTMLPRINTFROMCALC: to generate an HTML file using Calc (OpenOffice must be installed).
* HTMLPRINTFROMEXCEL: to generate an HTML file using Excel (Excel must be installed).
* PDFPRINT: to generate a PDF file.
* RAWPRINT: to print to a printer spool using binary format.
* SPREADSHEETPRINT: to generate an Excel file using BIFF format (no Excel nor OpenOffice needed).

When omited, cPrintLibrary defaults to the value of \_OOHG\_PrintLibrary global variable.
\_OOHG\_PrintLibrary also sets the default printing library for "Report form", "Edit" and "Edit Extended" commands.
The starting values of \_OOHG\_PrintLibrary is "MINIPRINT".
